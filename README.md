# QuizUsingAPI
<h3>This is my first project using API</h3></br>
This project uses Open Trivia DB API, it is a free JSON API.</br>
Use of this API does not require a API Key, just generate the URL by clicking <a href="https://opentdb.com/api_config.php" target="_blank">here</a> and use it in your own application to retrieve trivia questions.
